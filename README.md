# A-license-key-system-for-discord.js
A bot created in discord.js, after a member joined server, a bot is gonna direct message member and ask for the key of keyauth.cc (key system dashboard), if he provide the correct working key he can enter, if he doesn't he will be kicked.
You also need to put in credentials.json the stuff from dashboard like App credentials code. Please note to select Javascript to make it work!
